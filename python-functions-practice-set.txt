10. Write a Python program to print the even numbers from a given list. 
Sample List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Expected Result : [2, 4, 6, 8]

11. Write a Python function to check whether a number is perfect or not.
According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).
Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.

12. Write a Python function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not.
Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

13. Write a Python function that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle. 
Note : Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal.

Each number is the two numbers above it added together 

14. Write a Python function to check whether a string is a pangram or not. 
Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

15. Write a Python program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically. 
Sample Items : green-red-yellow-black-white
Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow

16. Write a Python function to create and print a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 30 (both included). 

17. Write a Python program to make a chain of function decorators (bold, italic, underline etc.) in Python. 

18. Write a Python program to execute a string containing Python code. 

19. Write a Python program to access a function inside a function. 

20. Write a Python program to detect the number of local variables declared in a function. 

21. Create a function that can accept two arguments name and age and print its value

22.Write a function func1() such that it can accept a variable length of  argument and print all arguments value

23.Write a function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate the addition and subtraction of it. And also it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call

24. Create a function showEmployee() in such a way that it should accept employee name, and it’s salary and display both, and if the salary is missing in function call it should show it as 9000

25. Create an inner function to calculate the addition in the following way

26. Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to 10

27. Assign a different name to function and call it through the new name

28. Generate a Python list of all the even numbers between 4 to 30

29. Return the largest item from the given list
aList = [4, 6, 8, 24, 12, 2]

Expected Output:

24

30. Print multiplication table of 12 using recursion.

31. Write a function to calculate power of a number raised to other ( ab ) using recursion.

32.Write a function “perfect()” that determines if parameter number is a perfect number. Use this function in a program that determines and prints all the perfect numbers between 1 and 1000.
[An integer number is said to be “perfect number” if its factors, including 1(but not the number itself), sum to the number. E.g., 6 is a perfect number because 6=1+2+3].

33.Write a function to find factorial of a number but also store the factorials calculated in a dictionary as done in the Fibonacci series example.

34. Make a simplest possible Python program that calculates and prints the value of the formula

y=6x2+3x+2,for$x=2$.

35.  Make a Python function that takes x as argument and returns y. Call the function for x=2 and print the answer.

36. Let y=x2. Make a program that writes the text
     
y(2.550)=6.502
if x=2.55. The values of x and y should be written with three decimals. Run the program for x=π too (the value if π is available as the variable pi in the math module).

37. Define a sequence of numbers,

xn=n2+1,
for integers n=0,1,2,…,N. Write a program that prints out xn for n=0,1,…,20 using a while loop.
